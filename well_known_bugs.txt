1) When application crashed suddenly, encryption fails to encrypt stored password file.  Restart the app with
correct master password entered will fix the problem.

2) Commas in password can also create issues such as password gets cut at the comma point.  This issue could be that
password is being stored in csv format and comma is being used as a delimiter.

3) Trying to edit a login but trying to generate password more than once results in logins info return as None or
empty in the entry fields.

4) Due to string sanitization of user's input password, the length of the password might not be true length since
the sanitization will try to remove any comma and quotation mark that is present in the password string.  The
temporary fix I added using list comprehension to replace any comma and quotation mark in string with string module's
string.punctuation seems to be inadequate because perhaps the strip method was also in used to remove any space and
extra starting and ending quotation marks.  This reminds me to use strip method to remove any starting and ending
comma too -- but this will need to be done on another day.
